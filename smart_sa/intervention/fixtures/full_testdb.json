Having lots of CD4 cells means you can fight off invaders and stay healthy.</p>\r\n<p>Over time, HIV weakens your immune system by killing off your CD4 cells. With few or no CD4 cells, your body cannot fight off invaders. With few or no CD4 cells, you can get sick really easily - you have no defenses against germs, viruses, and sickness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctors measure your immune system when they take your bloods. They can actually tell how many CD4 cells you have in your body by the <strong>CD4 cell count test</strong>. <strong>The more CD4 cells they find, the better!&nbsp;</strong>A healthy CD4 count is considered anything above 500. Doctors start to be concerned when your CD4 count goes below 500.</p>\r\n<p>When the CD4 count drops below 350, ARVs&nbsp;are usually recommended. That's why the clinic wants you to start ARVs now - your defenses are low and your body needs help to fight off the HIV.</p>\r\n<p>Do you know what your CD4 count is?</p>",

With few or no CD4 cells, you can get sick really easily - you have no defenses against germs, viruses, and sickness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctors measure your immune system when they take your bloods. They can actually tell how many CD4 cells you have in your body by the&nbsp;<strong>CD4 cell count test</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>The more CD4 cells they find, the better!&nbsp;</strong>A healthy CD4 count is considered anything above 500. Doctors start to be concerned when your CD4 count goes below 500.</p>\r\n<p>When the CD4 count drops below 350, ARVs&nbsp;are usually recommended.

Having lots of CD4 cells means you can fight off invaders and stay healthy.</p>\r\n<p>Over time, HIV weakens your immune system by killing off your CD4 cells. With few or no CD4 cells, your body cannot fight off invaders. With few or no CD4 cells, you can get sick really easily - you have no defenses against germs, viruses, and sickness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Doctors measure your immune system when they take your bloods. They can actually tell how many CD4 cells you have in your body by the&nbsp;<strong>CD4 cell count test</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>The more CD4 cells they find, the better!&nbsp;</strong>A healthy CD4 count is considered anything above 500. Doctors start to be concerned when your CD4 count goes below 500.</p>\r\n<p>When the CD4 count drops below 350, ARVs&nbsp;are usually recommended. That's why the clinic wants you to start ARVs - your defenses are low and your body needs help to fight off the HIV.</p>\r\n<p>Do you know what your CD4 count is?</p>",
